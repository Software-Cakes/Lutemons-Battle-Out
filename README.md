## Game Features
### Home Page (Main Activity) üè†
The Home Page displays all collected Lutemons in a card-based layout. Each card shows the Lutemon‚Äôs name, image, type, XP, and level. A counter in the top-right shows the total number of Lutemons in the user's collection. By tapping a Lutemon's card (View Details Activity), a scrollable popup appears with detailed information including type, XP, description, abilities, weaknesses, and awards.

To add a new Lutemon, users press the ‚ÄúAdd Lutemon‚Äù button on the first card. This opens a new screen with a searchable RecyclerView list of available Lutemons. Each Lutemon card includes an info popup and an ‚ÄúAdd to Collection‚Äù button, which triggers a confirmation dialog. Upon selecting "Yes," the Lutemon is added to the user‚Äôs collection.

### Training Page ü¶æ
Lutemons can increase XP by training with a randomly chosen opponent of similar strength. The user selects a Lutemon, and the game generates an opponent with comparable XP. Both characters are displayed with star bars and selectable attack/defense options.

Training ends when a Lutemon's health reaches zero. If the user‚Äôs Lutemon wins, XP is awarded and the victory is announced. Users can exit training at any time using the Home or Battle icons, with a confirmation dialog to prevent accidental exits.

### Battle Page üëæ
Battles are high-stakes gameplay where Lutemons can win awards and gain larger XP boosts. The user chooses a Lutemon, and the game randomly generates a stronger opponent.
The opponent strikes first, followed by the user's choice of move. Health bars for both Lutemons track progress. The game announces victory with a huge star graphic or defeat with a retry/X screen. A retry button is provided in case of loss. As with training, users can exit via Home or Training icons, with a confirmation prompt
